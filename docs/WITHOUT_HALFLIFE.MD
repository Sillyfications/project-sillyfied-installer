# Running the install without Half-Life

There is generally no benefit for using this program without Half-Life 1, but for testing purposes - here is a small guide on how to still use the installer.

## Steps

Make a temporary folder to a folder you can easilly access (i.e. Downloads or Documents).

Download the installer normally, until it asks for the Steam/Half-Life directory. Paste the path where the folder is in the terminal and everything should work.
