# Building

Because of difficulties, I have decided to split the Windows and Linux codebases. When possible, I might combine them into one base in the future.

For building on Windows, press [here](https://github.com/Sillyfications/project-sillyfied-installer/blob/main/docs/build/BUILDING_WIN.md).
For building on Linux, press [here](https://github.com/Sillyfications/project-sillyfied-installer/blob/main/docs/build/BUILDING_LIN.md).
