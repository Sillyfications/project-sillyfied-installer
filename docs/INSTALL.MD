# Installing the mod
> This guide assumes you already have the binary installed from Releases. If you haven't, download the binary first!

Unpack and run the executable. (For Linux users, the program needs to be ran inside the terminal).

> For Linux users: The executable needs to be in the home directory.

The installer does some checks and tries to find the Steam directory. If the installer cannot find the Steam folder, it will prompt you to give a path of the Steam folder.

> For Linux users: Due to a bug, it cannot find the Steam folder. Type `.steam//steam//` when asked. (#10)

If everything went well, you will see the home menu. Press on `i` to start the install.

After couple of seconds the mod should be installed, restart Steam for the mod to show up in your library or launch HL1 with the launch option `-game projsil`
