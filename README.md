# project-sillyfied-installer
An installer for a Half-Life modification. Install, update, remove or add optional addons to the mod. To build the project see [BUILDING.MD]().

### Requirements
Windows: [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/)
Linux: 7-zip, but most major distros come with 7zip preinstalled.
Both platforms: Steam and the Steam version of Half-Life 1. WON (World Opponent Network), Pre-Steampipe, cracked or Xash3D with or without FWGS is not supported! There are workarounds to still use this program without Half-Life 1, but it will not do much.
